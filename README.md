## Use
To use the `duo_tilt.gmx` you must have some form of Game Maker Studio 1.
The game is designed to also work with windows (with some extra features), so recompiling for PC should work fine. 

## Notes
* This project began as a Summer project in late May/early June 2018. After three weeks of work it was dropped in
favor of other projects. I wanted to finish the project by the end of summer (as I'd probably never work on it
again), but after a hiatus I returned to package the game even though it would be stripped of the features originally
planned. 
   * Instead of designing music for the game, I slowed down crappy .wav tracks I made in the 11th grade
   * I never updated the skins of the players from really generic balls
   * I never finished any of the levels or bosses originally planned
     * The first level (aside from tutorial) can still be found from the settings menu
* A note on sprites: It was until halfway through development I realized that making crappy sprites was tedius, that's when
I began implementing having the computer draw squares instead of me. Ultimately, I think it gives it a nice look.
